# the brain trust

Welcome to the brain trust.

## Getting started

The top level folders in this repository represent stand-alone projects.
Go into any directory and read the README.md file to get them up and running.

You can see our public facing website at <https://the-brain-trust.com>.

## Runbook

Development is assumed to be under an OS X environment. Node.js will largely
be used for server-side development, strong Javascript skills are a must.

Elastic Beanstalk will be used to host our production environments. We use
[Codeship](https://codeship.com/) for CI and CD.

If you're using [Sublime](<http://www.sublimetext.com/>), you can use the
sublime-settings file found in this repository to be consistent with the rest of
the team.

## Style Guide

For simplicity, we generally follow the
[AirBnb ES5 Javascript](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/es5)
style guide. Folks are welcome to make use ES6, be aware that available features
are highly dependent on the node version.
