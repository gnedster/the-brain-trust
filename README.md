# the brain trust

Welcome to the brain trust.

## Getting started

The top level folders in this repository represent stand-alone projects.
Go into any directory and read the README.md file to get them up and running.

You can see our public facing website at <https://the-brain-trust.com>.

## Runbook

Development is assumed to be under an OS X environment. Node.js will largely
be used for server-side development, strong Javascript skills are a must.

Elastic Beanstalk will be used to host our production environments. There is no
testing infrastructure at the moment, although there ought to be.

If you're using [Sublime](<http://www.sublimetext.com/>), you can use the
sublime-settings file found in this repository to be consistent with the rest of
the team.
